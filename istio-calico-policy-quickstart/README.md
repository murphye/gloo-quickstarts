This Quickstart will examine the use of Calico NetworkPolicy with Istio. These policies can be used in a broader Gloo Mesh deployment.

Would be interesting to have a demo of NetworkPolicy based on CIDR ranges.

Note: This doesn't take into account Gloo Edge which also can be used to secure traffic from outside of the mesh.
