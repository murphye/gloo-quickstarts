# Gloo Edge OpenShift 4.7 Quickstart (Work in Progress)

## About this Quickstart

This Quickstart is intended to show the very basics of installing Gloo Edge onto OpenShift 4.7 (CodeReady Containers) and running a simple Petstore application demo.

## Time to Complete

This will take you **about 20 minutes**.

## System Requirements

**You will need at least 16 GB of system memory, otherwise OpenShift CodeReady Containers may not start up.** If using a virtual machine, increase the size of your memory allocation to the VM.

## Prerequisites

These setup commmands use Homebrew, and work on Mac and Linux.
